### Project structure and Usage: 

#### week2 code folder contains following files:
1) lc1.py - list comprehensions and loops (species)
2) lc2.py - list comprehensions and loops (months and rainfall values)
3) dictionary.py - dictionary (species names classified according to their order)
4) tuples.py - tuples (birds species)
5) loops.py - learning how loops work
6) MyExampleScript.py - a very simple Python script
7) cfexercises1.py - control flow exercises 1
8) cfexercises2.py - exercising with functions and lists comprehensions
9) oaks.py - loops and list comprehensions (oak species)
10) scope.py - understanding the concept of the scope and global and loca variables
11) basic_io1.py - opening and printing the content of the file
12) basic_io2.py - creating an output file
13) basic_io3.py - creating a simple dictionary
14) basic_csv.py - manipulating CSV files
15) boilerplate.py - a boilerplate file
16) using_name.py - learning how modules work
17) sysarg.py - learning about the file arguments
18) control_flow.py - learning about programmes and functions
19) test_control_flow.py - learning about the control flow
20) debugme.py - learning how debugging works
21) align_seqs.py - programme that compares two DNA sequences 
22) oaks_debugme.py - searching for oka species in a give list
23) align_seq_fasta.py - Script to align two sequences after taking an input from user. It outputs one one best alignment in .csv format. If no input is provided it will run with defaults.
24) align_seq_better.py - Script to align two sequences after taking an input from user. It saves all the best alignments in binary format. If no input is provided the script will run with default arguements.
25) oaks_debugme_groupwork.py - This script checks whether the TestOaksData.csv input file contains a header, prints tree species and saves only the oak species.

**data folder** - contains input files

**results folder** - an empty folder that will be populated after runnig the above scripts

**sandbox folder** - contains practice files that can be ignored
